# Renderer progress

## Whole-file cubemap/gamma wave - 2026-10-22

Work only in gfx. Source: `target/work/src/`. Plan: [WHOLEFILE.md](WHOLEFILE.md).
This is the sole current progress/continuation log. Update it instead of creating
new handoffs. Machine proof receipts and technical reference notes stay separate.

### Verified state

- Previous source checkpoint: `5f9724e`; workspace consolidation: `084b513`.
  Current authored C/C++: **100419/253580 bytes (39.601%)**
  against the SUPPORTED game inventory, not the entire DLL.
- Mixed C/C++ and authored assembly:616 game bodies,108206 bytes.
  Assembly is excluded from the C/C++ meter. This wave adds **188 C/C++ bytes**.
- All822 previous protected extents retained; the ratchet now protects **824**.
  Negative controls reject removal of either new body.
- All **63** source/audit fixtures passed after a forced same-output rebuild.
  Warm/rebuilt binding JSON hashes are identical. No new assembly definitions
  or relaxed referee. The C/C++ attribution check is now mandatory in build.sh.
- Current receipt: `target/work/proof/cubemap_checkpoint.json`. Current referees:
  `target/work/proof/latest/`. Layout: `target/work/layout/current.json`.
- **Whole-file retail SHA does not match. No release or runtime proof.**

### Actual whole-file work completed

- New accepted source: BGRA vertical flip100266f0/97 and hardware gamma
  upload100307e0/91. The uploader copies the real512-byte GfxGammaRamp into
  three SDK gamma channels and routes it to the actual target swap chain.
- Added complete source for cubemap begin/end/save, readback, flipping,
  software gamma, TGA output and Fresnel-alpha routing. These close real API
  dependencies, but **only the two bodies above receive new coverage credit**.
  Tests cover90 begin cases,576 capture routes,144 saves (including257-pixel
  headers),48 hardware ramps and35 software-gamma buffers. Readback failure
  still flips; write failure still frees both buffers; original dangling saved
  pointers are preserved, not silently fixed.
- Remaining blockers: begin -> render-target setup -> viewport366; end ->
  gamma-table producer157; save -> copy89's one SIB encoding difference and
  alpha262-vs266 -> FresnelTerm. Several callers already have equal bytes but
  fail dependency binding. No masked-only or native-test result is credited.
- The producer's real second caller and GfxGammaRamp type fix its argument
  convention and two caller bodies. Its loop-tail scheduling remains different;
  stop syntax sweeps and use original TU/function-set evidence next.
- Gamma/alpha drafts reuse the existing I_fround assembly helper. They are
  unaccepted; accepted exclusions remain31 bodies/7787 bytes. If either later
  matches, its assembly expansion needs explicit exclusion review. The stricter
  build gate will reject unreviewed accounting instead of inflating C/C++ credit.

Previously accepted and still protected:

- Restored the real BeginDebugFrame callback, API59 slot49:73 bytes accepted.
  It saves the original frame pointers, unlocks the original vertex cache when
  needed and switches to the embedded debug frame. Eight routing tests pass.
- Restored typed debug-frame storage and pinned its used offsets at compile
  time. Candidate .data virtual size grows from1248244 to3648180 bytes, versus
  retail6086100. This is genuine state, not padding; full original global size
  and final placement are NOT independently proved by the callback match.
- Restored shared view setup10025570:286 bytes accepted. This is needed by
  LOD-origin and scene submission.192 view/LOD behavior cases pass. The LOD
  callback itself remains unaccepted: a floating constant operand width differs.
- Restored four primary-proven empty API callbacks and the sun-reset wrapper
  for eventual GetRefAPI closure. These receive **zero new credited bytes**;
  they are not invented substitutes for missing implementations.
- Current candidate has158 temporary exports and still no GetRefAPI.54 of98
  written API slots now have accepted implementations. The real front door is
  **not implemented yet**; completing its actual callback graph remains first.
- Current .text virtual size437792 versus retail1089680. Raw same-file-offset
  equality is2.044084%; this is a layout diagnostic, NOT source completion.
- Retail debug metadata pins an age1 PDB at the original c:\\builds path. Our
  reused PDB has a different GUID and increasing age. These remain real SHA
  blockers, not hash fields to silently ignore or patch.

### Cleanup

One active source tree and one incremental build; no duplicate build created.
Superseded handoffs, duplicate status files, notes, claims and rules are saved
in `archive/docs_20261021/`, not erased. Old goals and paths are not instructions.
Required gate inputs are local in `target/work/proof/history/`; API evidence
and inventory are local in `target/work/proof/retail/`. Inactive entrypoints are
in `archive/legacy_entrypoints/`. Shared target/src headers remain required.
Unrelated staged work is preserved, not bundled into this cleanup. No push.

### Next work

1. Recover API59 GetRefAPI and the typed callback/caller graph. Retail has 108
   slots: 98 written callbacks, ten initial zeros.54 written slots have accepted
   implementations; unverified does not mean source absent. Use primary code
   and `target/work/layout/api_callbacks.tsv`; never guess signatures or stub bodies.
2. Prioritize genuine shader SDK entrypoints to pull original library members,
   not library-internal reconstruction. The existing tested shader-table wrapper
   is still in tests/fixtures/unaccepted_shader_wrapper.cpp; earlier integration
   disturbed a CRT data binding. Reproduce that precise dependency/ownership
   failure and resolve it honestly before scaling shader source. Do not simply
   bypass the referee or import whole unverified reference trees.
3. Replace temporary roots with genuine reachability as connected groups close,
   retaining all accepted extents. Candidate has158 exports and no GetRefAPI;
   retail exports only GetRefAPI. Recover TU/data/library ownership alongside code.
4. Complete missing real source and original dependency calls. Reuse exact
   VC7.1/Summer2004 libraries and correct upstream source, not library reversal
   for a counter. Resolve exact layout and metadata, then cold rebuild and smoke.

Same-object relinking already reproduced raw .text/.data/.reloc but changed
timestamp/debug/.rdata/whole-file SHA. This is a real reproducibility blocker;
no output patching or normalized hash may substitute for retail identity.

### Resume

From gfx: `sh target/work/tools/build.sh`. Use `--rebuild` only when warranted.
Full fixtures: `python3 target/work/tests/run.py` (fails immediately on a failed
child). A stale broad extraction in the viewport fixture included the new gamma
function; it now extracts only its intended setter. All assertions remain.
One output: `target/build/codex_boundsoutside_1016_02`; `target/work/build` is
a symlink, not a duplicate. No own builds remain running. Before retrying source
forms, read `target/work/ATTEMPTS.md` and archived NOTES.md. Do not repeat the
three recorded LOD syntax trials; investigate genuine compiler/caller context.
The shared view helper and debug callback now MUST survive every wave. r_bsp upload/init
and light-history drafts remain unaccepted: preserve them without counting them.
Do connected source work next, not another parser/report framework.

Anchor SHA256:
`4553b22daff76e1f628d7ba16fda840b8ba415ae5024072b279fe8b820f634f6`.
Latest candidate SHA256:
`3076306cda3d65f4e647e7d9cd8bd48d8f1355e8e0dcda5e46d32377dac918a7`.

### Limits

Forced full compilation in the one existing build passed; no independent fresh
checkout replay or client/GPU smoke test. Historical layout receipts are frozen
in proof rather than pointing at the mutable layout/current.json.
No reliable whole-project completion percentage or release date is established.
Renderer checks no longer need dev/codex, **but client/deepseek tools still use
codex/client/salvage_gemini/data/names_1.0.json**. Deleting that folder can break
those tracks; they were not modified here. No retail binaries/assets committed.
